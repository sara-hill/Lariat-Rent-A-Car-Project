# Lariat-Rent-A-Car-Project
A repository of all the files used for my first capstone at Thinkful!

Decision-makers at Lariat have a dataset that they want you to use. 
They have also defined some high-level business objectives that they want to meet, 
including minimizing costs and maximizing revenue. But they're looking to you to derive 
insights from the rental fleet data and recommend strategies for reaching their goals.

As a consulting data analyst for Lariat, I was hired to make recommendations about how to make
better decisions, which is measured in terms of the costs and revenue generated by the
rental car fleet.

In this project, I produced the following deliverables:
1. An Excel model that they can use to make data-informed decisions about their fleet. 
   This should be based on the observed costs and revenue data from their fleet in recent years.
2. A PowerPoint deck that provides an analysis of the problem and provides recommendations.
